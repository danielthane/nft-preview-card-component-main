## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried extra hard to utilise sematic HTML in this project, the areas that i particularly struggled were with the price and the time left. I believe that as these dont have any sematic impotance that a <span> element is fine? But I'm certainly not 100% sure!

I also really enjoyed learning about they way we can use a hover selector in order to prompt a different element to do something as seen below.

```css
.img-container:hover .overlay {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

I think in future projects I will be focussing on how to make responsive layouts as I feel I now have got to grips with the basics of HTML and CSS for fixed sixe patges.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools howto pages](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_icon.asp) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
